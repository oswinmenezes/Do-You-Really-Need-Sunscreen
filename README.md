# Do-You-Really-Need-Sunscreen
This project is a **UV Index &amp; Sun-Screen Advisory Web App** ðŸŒž. It takes a city name from the user, fetches its location coordinates via the Geocoding API, then retrieves real-time UV index data using the OpenUV API. Based on the UV level, it gives a simple verdict on whether wearing sunscreen is necessary.
